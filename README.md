# SklFix
A program that fixes a skl file from .zip or .fantome automatically.

## Usage
You only need to do is drag and drop your folder or file onto __SklFix.exe__

If you only want to edit the skl I recommend you this one: [link](https://github.com/Morilli/LeagueToolkit/releases/tag/0.2)

## Note:
There's a few zip files that will not work. (I'll see what I can do about that v:)
